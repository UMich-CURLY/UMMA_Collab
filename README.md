# Robotics+UMMA Student Art Exhibition

## Our Project
Robotics institute and the University of Michigan Museum of Art (UMMA) have been collaborating to imagine how a robot could encourage visitors’ curiosity and transform their art museum experience through interactive conversations. This partnership exemplifies the values of the U-M Arts Initiative, an organization that supports intentional cross-disciplinary projects that advance science, culture, and equity.

## Our Goals 
- Encourage collaborative research between humanities and engineering disciplines
- Activate museum galleries as laboratories for learning
- Expand visitors’ understanding of what a museum can offer
- Create an inclusive museum environment by offering choice: recognize that some visitors prefer to interact with a machine than a human
- Invoke new and subtle understanding of art for our visitors
- Promote visitor curiosity about art
- Spark conversation and deepen human relationships 
- Explore how robots can adapt to dynamic and evolving cultural spaces

Our Student Artists Inspire us to envision what a robot in a museum might look like 

Michigan Robotics and UMMA staff have some ideas, but artists often can envision a future that others haven’t yet imagined. We wondered what possibilities two students from Penny W. Stamps School of Art and Design might come up with. We hoped they would lead the Robotics-UMMA team to new directions or undiscovered paths.
